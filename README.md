# OSM Bright for Mapbox Studio

A full-featured template / example project for Mapbox Studio using OpenMapTiles vector tiles.

Modified for CARTO Mobile SDK. Some of the changes are stylistic, but
most are fixes and performance improvements. To use it with the SDK,
simply compress the project using ZIP and use the resulting file as
a compiled style asset.
